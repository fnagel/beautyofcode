Upgrade Guide
=============


If there's no upgrade guide, there' s no need to change anything. This guide
does not covering extending via PHP (aka XCLASS or Hooks) – you need to check
changes for yourself.


3.1 to 3.2
^^^^^^^^^^

What you need to know:

- Now compatible with TYPO3 8.7
- Show default header in BE preview
- Use FormEngine NodeFactory API instead if XCLASS
- Update Prism to 1.6.0


3.0 to 3.1
^^^^^^^^^^

What you need to know:

- Now compatible with TYPO3 8.4 (please make sure to use root template for adding static TS when using 8.x)
- Bugfix for t3editor EM configuration (thanks to Thomas Kieslich!)
- Bugfix for new content element wizard configuration
- Code is now PSR-2 standard compliant


2.x to 3.0
^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make this extension work best possible in TYPO3 7.x and to make maintaining
more easier (especially the t3editor implementation) this version introduces usage of the
default `tt_content` `bodytext` field.

What you need to know:

- Removed TYPO3 6.x support
- There is an update wizard available through Extension Manager to migrate your existing records
- Almost no visible changes in backend user interface
- Make sure to adopt your TypoScript (assigning your settings to `module.` for backend context)
- Updated PrimJs vendor to version 1.3.0
- Add some new PrimsJs languages (Actionscript, Applescript, Diff, Erlang, Git, Sass, Scala, Twig, Less, MarkDown, Powershell, Yaml)
- Use core icon for plugin and wizard
- Added a composer.json and a bower.json file
- Improved code style


1.0 to 2.0
^^^^^^^^^^

Rewritten for Extbase/Fluid.

What you need to know:

- Execute update script within extension manager to update adjusted plugin names
  in database
- You'll need to change your TypoScript code

  - SyntaxHighlighter v2 + beautyofcode (jQuery) abstraction layer was removed
  - include the correct static template
  - removed TypoScript constants / setup paths:

    - jquery.scriptUrl (adapt template if you need to adjust)
    - jQueryNoConflict (inline JS is wrapped in module pattern style code)
    - config.strings (<f:translate /> vhs in templates)
    - addjQuery (please make sure to include jQuery by yourself if you want to
      use the `includeAsDomReady` / `onReadyCallback` configuration settings
    - selector

Please see the changelog for all changes in detail.


0.6 to 0.7
^^^^^^^^^^

Big update: finally its possible to use this extension without jQuery. Massive
remanufacturing and code changes. Please consider this release as a beta
version as I did test every feature the best I can but not sure if everything
will work out on every TYPO3 installation.

What you need to know:

- You'll need to change your TypoScript code

   - paths for base, scripts and styles
   - addjQuery and selector have been moved to the jquery. Array
   - some variables have been slightly renamed

- Extension Manager settings has been removed, use TS configuration instead
- SyntaxHighlighter v3 changed some features (learn more: “Which version to choose”)

Please see the changelog for all changes in detail.


0.5 to 0.6
^^^^^^^^^^

This version introduces HTML templating. That's why some TS options are not
longer available or renamed:

- `plugin.tx_beautyofcode_pi1.label.wrap` is removed as it's now configured via template
- `plugin.tx_beautyofcode_pi1.label.show` is renamed to showLabel
- `plugin.tx_beautyofcode_pi1.wrap` is removed as it's now configured via template
